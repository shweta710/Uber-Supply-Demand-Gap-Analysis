# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Analysis

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.  

1. Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
2. Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
3. Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
4. Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
5. What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
6. Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
